Since ancient times, humans and monsters have waged bitter war against one another in the bowels of the treacherous dungeon beneath Orario. Enmity between these races is an accepted and immutable fact — or at least it was until Bell Cranel stumbled across a young, blue-skinned girl in the dungeon’s dark depths. When this inhuman young woman speaks to him in the language of human beings and looks at him with all-too-human eyes, the land of Orario erupts into turmoil the likes of which it has never seen.

※ NOTE: Second season of ""The Irregular at Magic High School""
October 31st, 2095. The southernmost tip of the Korean Peninsula was annihilated due to an unidentified Strategic-Class magic. Known as “Scorched Halloween,” this day marked the arrival of a new Strategic-Class magician who would shake up the world.
Sensing an impending crisis, the USNA secretly deploys Stars – the most powerful magician unit in the world – in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth about the unidentified Strategic-Class magic and the magician who used it. Approximately two months later, on December 24th, as people bustle through the city decorated with Christmas lights,
Tatsuya and his friends gather at Cafe Einebrise for a farewell party for Rei before she goes off to America as an exchange student for three months. According to her, a girl who is the same age as her will be entering Magic High School as her visiting counterpart.
Meanwhile, at the USNA Stars’ base, a girl prepares to go undercover to investigate First High School. Her name is Angelina Kudou Shields. She is the youngest person in the history of Stars to become commander, and as USNA’s most powerful magician she wields the Strategic-Class magic known as Heavy Metal Burst.

The second season of <i>Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei</i>.<br>
<br>
Miyuki Shiba’s classmate Kitayama Shizuku is on her way to study abroad. For magicians, this is normally impossible, since allowing the genes of someone who can use magic outside their home country’s borders is tantamount to giving up national secrets. But it’s allowed to happen in one case—exchange programs.<br>
<br>
And that’s how Angelina Kudou Shields, known as Lina, has arrived in Japan from the USNA to study at First High. Around the time Lina arrived in Japan, magicians began getting attacked by a mysterious being who leaves his victims drained of blood. Will Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba be able to discover the identity of the “Vampire”?<br>

One day, to save a friend who has been attacked by Curses, he eats the finger of the Double-Faced Specter, taking the Curse into his own soul. From then on, he shares one body with the Double-Faced Specter.

It's not about the destination...
What's your favorite story? Does it have a hero who slays a dragon and saves a princess? Or a child of prophecy destined for greatness? Well, my favorite story is a little different. It's the tale of a witch who travels the world, seeking nothing in particular. With no quest of her own, she's free to wander wherever the wind takes her, adding a few pages to the story of whomever she meets before setting off on her next adventure. At the end of her travels, the witch takes on an apprentice who will one day begin her own journey. And so the cycle continues, or so the story goes. Now, the witch who starts the story anew...who could she be?
[Source: Yen Press ]
Once upon a time, there was a witch named Elaina, who set off on a journey across the world. Along the way, she would meet all kinds of people, from a country full of witches to a giant in love with his own muscles-but with each meeting, Elaina would become a small part of their story, and her own world would get a little bit bigger.<br>

In the late 19th century, Great Britain rules over a quarter of the world. Nobles sit in their fancy homes in comfort and luxury, while the working class slaves away at their jobs. When young Albert James Moriarty’s upper-class family adopts two lower-class orphans, the cruelty the boys experience at his family’s hands cements Albert’s hatred of the nobility he was born into. He asks the older of the two boys—who has a genius mind and a killer instinct—to help him rid the world of evil, starting with Albert’s own family!

The Pillars suddenly appeared on Earth, posing a threat to all life forms. Running out of options to protect themselves, humanity finds itself on the brink of extinction, but a god named Odin offers them a way to salvation. Odin proclaims a counterattack against the Pillars by bestowing humanity with young female pilots with supernatural powers, the Valkyries, and their spirit fighter planes as a means of fighting back.
The battle between humanity and the Pillars has not abated, even after several years have passed. The Valkyries in their spirit fighter planes, as well as the men who support them, risk their lives in the skies to save the Earth.
Japan is no exception. Three Valkyries fight against huge Pillars that tower over sacred Mt Fuji. They are all very skilled, but every last one of them is a troublemaker. An ace pilot joins them from Europe, but she has a checkered past...
""Humanity, now is the time to fight back. The final battle of Ragnarok is fast approaching.""
The Pillars suddenly appeared above Earth, threatening all life. A god who called himself Odin came to the aid of humanity as it was driven to near complete defeat. To counter the Pillars, Odin declared a counterattack by bequeathing humanity with the battle maidens Walküres and the ""herocraft"" as their wings.
<br><br>
Several years later, the battle between humanity and Pillars rages on, with men supporting the Walküres as they soar through the treacherous skies to save the world.
<br><br>
Japan is no exception. Three Walküres confront the giant Pillar looming over sacred Mt. Fuji. Each Walküre is skilled, but each also has issues. And now, an ace pilot has arrived from Europe.

Set in Hinomoto, a fictional version of Japan, where for a long time railway travel served as the most important form of transport. Each locomotive was paired with a humanoid control module, so-called Raillord, that aided the train operator. However, many rail lines had been discontinued due to the rising popularity of 'aerocrafts,' a safe and convenient aerial mode of transport. As such, their accompanying railroads also went into a deep sleep.
Soutetsu had lost his entire family in a rail accident and was adopted into the Migita household, which runs a shochu brewery in the city of Ohitoyo. He returned to his hometown to save it from the potential water pollution that would occur if they accepted the proposal to build an aerocraft factory nearby. He woke up the Raillord Hachiroku by accident and became her owner. For different purposes, they agreed to help find her lost locomotive, with the help of his stepsister Hibiki, the town’s mayor and local railway chief, Paulette and others.

In a world where women now dominate the government, the creation and use of weapons is strictly forbidden. However, by no means has conflict been brought to an end; instead of weapons, war is waged through words. With the power of the ""Hypnosis Mic,"" lyrics can affect one's opponent in various ways and cause real damage. Those in the divisions outside the women-only Chuou Ward thus use it for fierce rap battles as their weapon in the constant clash for territory.
[Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode]
After the war, women have taken over ruling politics in the Chuo ward and have banned and destroyed weapons. This has caused men to fight through rap battles using Hypnosis Mics, which can be used to affect people's sympathetic nerves and influence their thought process. However, the legendary rap group, The Dirty Dawg, has split up into four groups, each representing a division of Tokyo, Japan and are engaging in territorial battles using words and the HypMics.
