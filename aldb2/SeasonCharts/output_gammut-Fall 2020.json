Aliceliese is the Princess of the Nebulis Sovereignty, called the \"Ice Calamity Witch\" with fear by her enemies.\nThe two meet on the battlefield and become mortal enemies. Prides lock horns as they both fight uncompromisingly to protect their respective nations, families, and comrades.\nBut as they get to know each other as real people during their fierce battles, they start to become attracted to each other\u2019s ways of life and ideals... though they are fully aware that fate will mock them cruelly, not allowing them to be together.\n...Sure enough, the world's tension heightens even more, and conspiracies of the major nations become more entangled. But even in such a world divided, this boy and girl cannot stop their feelings for each other\u2026\n[Source: KADOKAWAanime ]\nEmbroiled in a hundred-year war, young Iska is sent to assassinate the Ice Calamity Witch, Aliceliese.
