The story follows Benio \"Haikara-san\" Hanamura, who lost her mother when she was very young and has been raised by her father, a high-ranking official in the Japanese army. As a result, she has grown into a tomboy -- contrary to traditional Japanese notions of femininity, she studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in often outlandish-looking Western fashions instead of the traditional kimono, and is not as interested in housework as she is in literature. She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman's right to a career and to marry for love.\nHaikara-san's best friends are the beautiful Tamaki, who is much more feminine than Haikara-san but equally interested in women's rights, and Ranmaru, a young man who was raised to play female roles in the kabuki theater and as a result has acquired very effeminate mannerisms. Haikara-san's betrothed is Shinobu Ij\u016bin, a second lieutenant in the army.\n(Source: Anime News Network)", "tags": [{"tag": "Comedy", "spoiler": false}, {"tag": "Drama", "spoiler": false}, {"tag": "Historical", "spoiler": false}, {"tag": "Romance", "spoiler": false}, {"tag": "Shoujo", "spoiler": false}], "startdate": "25/04/2018 00:00 +0900", "episodes": 0, "images": ["https://u.livechart.me/anime/poster_images/2203/7cf2d092fd0eb1770d28a059a8767625:small.jpg"], "studios": ["Nippon Animation"], "links": [["Website", "http://haikarasan.net"], ["Preview", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VZfapNOKxU"], ["Twitter", "https://twitter.com/haikara_anime"], ["Mal", "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33378"], ["Anidb", "http://anidb.net/a12149"], ["Anime-Planet", "http://www.anime-planet.com/anime/haikara-san-ga-tooru-movie"], ["Anisearch", "https://www.anisearch.com/anime/11483"], ["Kitsu", "https://kitsu.io/anime/12233"]]}, {"chartsource": [["Livechart", "3094"]], "season": "Spring-2018", "japanese_title": "\u7518\u3044\u61f2\u7f70\uff5e\u79c1\u306f\u770b\u5b88\u5c02\u7528\u30da\u30c3\u30c8", "romaji_title": "Amai Choubatsu: Watashi wa Kanshu Senyou Pet", "english_title": "Sweet Punishment", "additional_titles": ["Amai Choubatsu ~ Watashi wa Kanshu Sen'you Pet", "Amai Choubatsu: Watashi wa Kanshu Sen'you Pet", "Amai Choupatsu: Watashi wa Kanshuu Senyou Pet"], "medium": "", "continuing": false, "renewal": false, "summary": "(From Livechart)\nThe story is set in a prison in the near future.
